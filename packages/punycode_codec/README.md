A Dart implementation of the Punycode (RFC 3492) encoding algorithm used for
Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).

## Overview

This package provides a robust and efficient way to convert Unicode strings,
such as internationalized domain names or email addresses, into their ASCII-Compatible
Encoding (ACE) representation according to the Punycode specification (RFC 3492),
and back again.

Punycode allows representing Unicode characters using only the limited ASCII
character subset (letters, digits, and hyphens) allowed in components of
domain names. This is essential for the IDNA standard, enabling the use of
international characters in domain names while maintaining compatibility with
the existing DNS infrastructure. ACE labels generated by IDNA typically start
with the prefix `xn--`.

## Features

* **RFC 3492 Compliant:** Implements the Punycode encoding and decoding
    algorithms as specified in the standard.
* **IDNA Helpers:** Provides convenient methods (`toAscii`, `toUnicode`) for
    converting full domain names or email addresses, automatically handling
    the `xn--` prefix and processing only the necessary parts of the string.
* **Core Codec:** Offers direct access to the raw Punycode `encode` and `decode`
    operations via `PunycodeCodec` for advanced use cases.
* **Efficient and Tested:** Based on a port of the well-regarded Punycode.js
    library, including tests based on official RFC examples.
